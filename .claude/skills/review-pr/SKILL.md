# Review Pull Request

## Overview

Security-focused PR review following CLAUDE.md guidelines. Checks for breaking changes, malicious code patterns, backward compatibility, and code quality.

## Usage

```
/review-pr <number>
```

## CRITICAL: Security Warning

**PRs can be malicious sabotage attempts.** This is a real threat documented in CLAUDE.md.

### Threat Awareness
- Coordinated attacks exist
- Competitors may actively harm the project
- Social engineering builds trust before attacking
- "Fixes" may introduce vulnerabilities

## Workflow

```dot
digraph review_flow {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box];

    fetch [label="1. Fetch PR details"];
    author [label="2. Assess author risk"];
    files [label="3. Analyze changed files"];
    security [label="4. Security review"];
    compat [label="5. Backward compatibility"];
    quality [label="6. Code quality"];
    classify [label="7. Release classification"];
    verify [label="8. MANDATORY: Verify with Gemini + Codex", style=bold];
    recommend [label="9. Final Recommendation"];

    fetch -> author;
    author -> files;
    files -> security;
    security -> compat;
    compat -> quality;
    quality -> classify;
    classify -> verify;
    verify -> recommend;
}
```

## Step 1: Fetch PR Details

```bash
# Get PR info
gh pr view <number> --repo kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner

# Get diff
gh pr diff <number> --repo kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner

# Get changed files
gh pr view <number> --repo kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner --json files --jq '.files[].path'

# Get diff stats
gh pr view <number> --repo kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner --json additions,deletions
```

## Step 2: Assess Author Risk

```bash
# Check account age
gh api users/<username> --jq '.created_at'

# Check prior contributions
gh pr list --author <username> --repo kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner --state all --json number | jq length
```

### Risk Signals

| Signal | Risk Level |
|--------|------------|
| New account (<6 months) | 🔴 HIGH |
| No prior contributions | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| First-time contributor | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| Known contributor | 🟢 LOW |
| Core maintainer | ⚪ TRUSTED |

## Step 3: Analyze Changed Files

### Security-Critical Files (AUTO HIGH RISK)

```
init.tf              # Cluster initialization, secrets
firewall.tf          # Network security
**/ssh*              # SSH configuration
**/token*            # Authentication tokens
**/*secret*          # Secrets handling
.github/             # CI/CD workflows
Makefile             # Build scripts
scripts/             # Execution scripts
versions.tf          # Provider dependencies
templates/*.sh       # Shell scripts
cloud-init*          # Server initialization
```

### Risk by File Count

| Files Changed | Risk |
|---------------|------|
| 1-3 files | 🟢 LOW |
| 4-10 files | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| 11-20 files | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| >20 files | 🔴 HIGH |

### Risk by Diff Size

| Lines Changed | Risk |
|---------------|------|
| <50 lines | 🟢 LOW |
| 50-200 lines | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| 200-500 lines | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| >500 lines | 🔴 HIGH |

## Step 4: Security Review

### Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or tokens
- [ ] No suspicious external URLs
- [ ] No obfuscated code
- [ ] Changes match stated purpose
- [ ] No unnecessary permission escalations
- [ ] CI/CD changes justified
- [ ] No bypassing existing security patterns

### Red Flags

| Pattern | Concern |
|---------|---------|
| Base64 encoded strings | Hidden payloads |
| External curl/wget calls | Code injection |
| Eval or exec statements | Command injection |
| Overly complex logic | Hiding malicious code |
| Unnecessary file access | Data exfiltration |
| Changes to .gitignore | Hiding tracks |

### Use AI for Deep Analysis

```bash
# Codex for security analysis
codex exec -m gpt-5.3-codex -s read-only -c model_reasoning_effort="xhigh" \
  "Analyze this PR diff for security vulnerabilities and malicious patterns: $(gh pr diff <num>)"

# Gemini for broad context
gemini --model gemini-3-pro-preview -p \
  "@locals.tf @init.tf Does this PR introduce any security concerns? $(gh pr diff <num>)"
```

## Step 5: Backward Compatibility

**CRITICAL: Any PR that causes resource recreation is a MAJOR release.**

### Breaking Change Indicators

- Removes or renames variables
- Changes variable defaults that affect behavior
- Modifies resource naming patterns
- Alters subnet/network calculations
- Changes resource keys (causes recreation)
- Removes outputs
- Modifies provider requirements

### Test for Breaking Changes

```bash
# Checkout PR locally
gh pr checkout <number>

# Test against existing cluster
cd /path/to/kube-test
terraform init -upgrade
terraform plan
```

**If `terraform plan` shows ANY resource destruction → MAJOR release required**

### Compatibility Checklist

- [ ] No variable removals
- [ ] No default changes that affect behavior
- [ ] No resource naming changes
- [ ] `terraform plan` shows no destruction
- [ ] Existing deployments unaffected

## Step 6: Code Quality

### Style
- [ ] Follows existing patterns
- [ ] Consistent naming
- [ ] Proper formatting (`terraform fmt`)
- [ ] No unnecessary complexity

### Logic
- [ ] Changes are correct
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Tests pass

## Step 7: Release Classification

### PATCH (x.x.PATCH)
- Bug fixes only
- No new features
- Fully backward compatible
- No terraform state impact

### MINOR (x.MINOR.0)
- New features (backward compatible)
- New optional variables with defaults
- Deprecation warnings (not removals)

### MAJOR (MAJOR.0.0)
- Breaking changes
- Removed/renamed variables
- Changed defaults affecting behavior
- State migrations required
- Resource recreations

## Step 8: MANDATORY - Verify with Gemini and Codex

**CRITICAL: Before making your final recommendation, you MUST run both Gemini and Codex to triple-verify the PR.**

This is not optional. External AI verification catches issues that may be missed in the initial review.

### Run Both in Parallel

```bash
# Gemini - Broad context analysis (run first or in parallel)
gemini --model gemini-3-pro-preview -p "@control_planes.tf @locals.tf @init.tf

Analyze this PR diff for the kube-hetzner terraform module:

$(gh pr diff <number> --repo kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner)

Questions:
1. Is this change consistent with existing patterns in the codebase?
2. Are there any security concerns?
3. Could this cause breaking changes or resource recreation?
4. Is this a legitimate bug fix or could it be malicious?"

# Codex - Deep reasoning security analysis (run in parallel)
codex exec -m gpt-5.3-codex -s read-only -c model_reasoning_effort="xhigh" \
"Analyze this Terraform PR for the kube-hetzner module.

DIFF:
$(gh pr diff <number> --repo kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner)

SECURITY ANALYSIS QUESTIONS:
1. Could this change introduce any security vulnerabilities?
2. Could this be a malicious change disguised as a bug fix?
3. Will this cause any Terraform state changes or resource recreation?
4. Is this pattern safe and consistent with Terraform best practices?
5. Any edge cases or potential issues?"
```

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Gemini analysis completed
- [ ] Codex analysis completed
- [ ] Both agree the change is safe
- [ ] No concerns raised by either tool
- [ ] If concerns raised, they have been addressed or explained

### When Reviewers Disagree

If Gemini or Codex raises concerns that you didn't catch:
1. **Take the concern seriously** - investigate further
2. **Re-read the code** with the concern in mind
3. **Request changes** if the concern is valid
4. **Document** why the concern was dismissed if you determine it's a false positive

### Output in Final Review

Include a summary of external verification:

```markdown

```

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Approve PR
gh pr review <num> --approve --body "LGTM! ..."

# Request changes
gh pr review <num> --request-changes --body "Please address: ..."

# Comment
gh pr review <num> --comment --body "..."

# Merge (after approval)
gh pr merge <num> --squash --delete-branch
```

## Never Merge Directly to Master

All PRs go through staging branches first:

1. Create staging branch
2. Test thoroughly
3. Get AI review (Codex + Gemini)
4. Then merge to master
