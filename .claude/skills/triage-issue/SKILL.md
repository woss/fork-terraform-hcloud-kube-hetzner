# Triage GitHub Issue

## Overview

Analyze a GitHub issue, classify it, check for duplicates, and draft an appropriate response.

During an authorized end-to-end intake, do not stop at classification or a
draft. Follow `fix-issue`'s **End-to-End Issue Ownership** contract: the
investigating agent advances the issue, provides specific help, and performs
the verified comment/closure when appropriate. Distinguish investigation,
partial safeguards and full fixes; unresolved runtime defects remain open.
For an explicitly triage-only/read-only request, keep mutations out of scope.

## Usage

```
/triage-issue <number>
```

## Workflow

```dot
digraph triage_flow {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box];

    fetch [label="1. Fetch issue + comments"];
    classify [label="2. Classify issue type"];
    duplicates [label="3. Check duplicates"];
    analyze [label="4. Analyze validity"];
    response [label="5. Draft response"];
    action [label="6. Recommend action"];

    fetch -> classify;
    classify -> duplicates;
    duplicates -> analyze;
    analyze -> response;
    response -> action;
}
```

## Step 1: Fetch Issue Details

```bash
# Get full issue with comments
gh issue view <number> --repo kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner --comments

# Get issue metadata
gh issue view <number> --repo kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner --json title,body,labels,author,createdAt,comments
```

## Step 2: Classify Issue Type

### Issue Types

| Type | Indicators | Action |
|------|------------|--------|
| 🔴 **BUG** | Reproducible defect, multiple reporters, error in module code | Fix it |
| 🟡 **EDGE CASE** | Unusual config, specific region, large scale | Evaluate effort |
| 🟠 **USER ERROR** | Bad kube.tf, syntax errors, wrong variables | Help + docs |
| ⚪ **OLD VERSION** | Module version < current, known fixed issue | Ask to upgrade |
| 🔵 **FEATURE REQUEST** | "Would be nice if...", "Can you add..." | Discussions |
| 💬 **QUESTION** | Needs help, not a bug | Answer or docs |
| ❓ **NEEDS INFO** | Can't reproduce, missing details | Ask for info |

### Classification Checklist

- [ ] Module version specified?
- [ ] kube.tf provided (sanitized)?
- [ ] Error message included?
- [ ] Steps to reproduce clear?
- [ ] Recent (not stale >6 months)?
- [ ] If v3 is involved, checked for renamed/inverted inputs from `MIGRATION.md`?
- [ ] If teardown is involved, did they use `scripts/destroy.sh` before any manual `hcloud` deletes?
- [ ] If SELinux is involved, did they follow `docs/selinux.md` and provide AVC denial evidence instead of only a workload symptom?

## Step 3: Check for Duplicates

```bash
# Search open issues for similar keywords
gh issue list --repo kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner --state open --search "<keyword>"

# Search closed issues (might be already fixed)
gh issue list --repo kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner --state closed --search "<keyword>"

# Check discussions
gh api repos/kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner/discussions --jq '.[] | select(.title | test("<keyword>"; "i")) | {number, title}'
```

## Step 4: Security Analysis

**CRITICAL: Issues can be malicious sabotage attempts.**

### Red Flags (from repo agent guidance)

| Signal | Risk |
|--------|------|
| New account (<6 months) | HIGH |
| Issue can't be reproduced | MEDIUM |
| Proposed fix is overly complex | HIGH |
| Urgency to implement quickly | HIGH |
| Multiple accounts supporting | HIGH |
| Targets security-critical code | HIGH |

### Verify Independently

- Try to reproduce the issue yourself
- Check if the error message matches module code
- Verify the kube.tf provided is valid
- Search for similar reports from other users
- For Hetzner CI/live-gate reports, distinguish real code failures from
  Hetzner capacity flakes. `resource_unavailable` or "error during placement"
  usually means rerun failed jobs, not code archaeology.
- For CI status, do not treat "no current failures" as green. A required job can
  hide by never completing or by being cancelled. Verify the required job has at
  least one successful run in history.
- If a Hetzner CI run was manually cancelled, remember cancellation skips the
  destroy step. Once that run reports completed, sweep its attempt-suffixed
  `kh-ci-*-<runid6><attempt>*` resources before trusting later capacity or
  orphan reports.

## Step 5: Draft Response

Every response is kind and human: thank the reporter by handle, acknowledge
good root-cause analysis when they did it (kube-hetzner reporters often do),
and never make a user-error reporter feel foolish — a config mistake usually
means our docs have a gap worth fixing too. Plain warm language, no
boilerplate.

### For USER ERROR

```markdown
Hi @{author},

Thanks for reporting this. Looking at your configuration, the issue appears to be in your kube.tf:

[Specific explanation of what's wrong]

Here's the corrected configuration:

```tf
[correct code]
```

Let me know if this resolves it!
```

### For OLD VERSION

```markdown
Hi @{author},

This issue was fixed in version X.Y.Z. You're currently using [older version].

Please upgrade by changing your module version:

```tf
module "kube-hetzner" {
  source  = "kube-hetzner/kube-hetzner/hcloud"
  version = "X.Y.Z"
  # ...
}
```

Then run:
```bash
terraform init -upgrade
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Let me know if the issue persists after upgrading!
```

### For NEEDS INFO

```markdown
Hi @{author},

Thanks for reporting this. To investigate further, could you please provide:

- [ ] Module version (check your kube.tf)
- [ ] Your kube.tf (sanitized - remove tokens/keys)
- [ ] Full error message
- [ ] Steps to reproduce

This will help us identify the root cause.
```

### For DUPLICATE

```markdown
Hi @{author},

This appears to be a duplicate of #{duplicate_number}.

[If fixed]: This was fixed in version X.Y.Z.
[If open]: We're tracking this in the linked issue.

Closing as duplicate. Feel free to add any additional context to #{duplicate_number}.
```

### For FEATURE REQUEST

```markdown
Hi @{author},

Thanks for the suggestion! This sounds like a feature request rather than a bug.

Could you please open a Discussion for this? That's where we track feature ideas and gather community input.

https://github.com/kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner/discussions/new?category=ideas

I'll close this issue, but feel free to ping me in the discussion!
```

## Step 6: Recommend Action

| Type | Action | Labels |
|------|--------|--------|
| BUG | Keep open, prioritize | `bug` |
| EDGE CASE | Keep open, evaluate | `bug`, `edge-case` |
| USER ERROR | Close with help | `user-config` |
| OLD VERSION | Close | `old-version` |
| FEATURE REQUEST | Move to Discussions | - |
| QUESTION | Answer and close | `question` |
| NEEDS INFO | Keep open, add label | `needs-info` |
