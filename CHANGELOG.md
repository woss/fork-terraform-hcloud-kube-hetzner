## [Unreleased]

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed K3s agents with floating IPs receiving the server-only `flannel-external-ip` flag, which prevented the agent service from starting. Floating-IP agents continue to advertise `node-external-ip`.
- Made the generated-site contract test portable to clean GitHub Actions runners instead of requiring undeclared `rg`. CI installs Zsh and Fish and fails closed when a documented shell verifier is missing; local runs print an explicit skip when an optional shell is unavailable.

### 🔧 Changes

- Kept GitHub CI focused on cheap required lint, documentation drift, and tag publication; HCloud smoke, credentials, cluster inspection, and teardown now remain local. Tag publication rejects missing release notes.
- Restored the one-command `createkh` and `cleanupkh` flows for Bash/Zsh and Fish. `scripts/create.sh` again works when downloaded directly, while manifest verification and atomic Packer bundle publication stay behind the simple entrypoint.

### 📚 Documentation

- Reorganized the README into a concise visual overview, four-step Quick Start, and documentation index; moved upgrades, support details, day-2 operations, recipes, and troubleshooting into focused guides while preserving the project-support and Hetzner acknowledgement footer.
- Added the K3s certificate-expiry recovery step for retrieving a renewed admin kubeconfig over SSH from a healthy control-plane node and replacing its loopback API endpoint locally.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-08-08

### ⚠️ Upgrade Notes

- **IPv6/dual-stack clusters:** static control-plane and agent nodes now render `node-ip` values that match the configured cluster CIDR families when `cluster_ipv6_cidr` / `service_ipv6_cidr` are set. Do not enable dual-stack in-place on an existing IPv4-only k3s/RKE2 cluster; cluster/service CIDR families are bootstrap-time choices and require a new cluster or blue/green migration. This adds new plan-time rejections for configurations that previously planned but could not boot correctly: missing effective public IPv6 on any static HCloud node, IPv6-only pod/service CIDRs on the standard private-network path, active autoscaler nodepools on the standard private-network path, `nat_router` with IPv6 cluster CIDRs, `extra_robot_nodes` with IPv6 cluster CIDRs, `node_transport_mode = "tailscale"` with IPv6 cluster CIDRs, public-overlay transport families that omit an enabled cluster CIDR family, and Cilium native routing with IPv6 cluster CIDRs. Use dual-stack, the default Cilium tunnel mode, static HCloud nodes, and public IPv6-enabled nodepools for the standard path.
- **Experimental public-overlay node IPs:** existing `multinetwork_mode = "cilium_public_overlay"` clusters may see control-plane `node-ip` change from private IPv4 to public overlay addresses and a k3s/RKE2 config restart, even with IPv4-only cluster CIDRs. This lab-only path is still not production-supported.
- **openSUSE SSH access on new/replaced nodes:** cloud-init no longer writes the `ssh_pwauth` override that shadowed openSUSE's vendor `sshd_config`, and kube-hetzner's SSH drop-in now explicitly keeps `UsePAM yes` while disabling keyboard-interactive authentication. This applies to newly provisioned or replaced openSUSE nodes; already affected nodes may need manual SSH rescue remediation or replacement.
- **Autoscaler node IPs on existing nodes:** the standard autoscaler now writes private `node-ip` during bootstrap for new/replaced autoscaled nodes, replacing the previous public IPv4 auto-detection on default public-route pools. Already-running autoscaled nodes keep their existing kubelet config until the autoscaler recycles them or you drain/delete them intentionally; top-level `node-ip` values in `agent_nodes_custom_config` remain unsupported and are overridden on autoscaler-created nodes.
- **Custom Leap Micro Packer mirrors:** custom `opensuse_leapmicro_*_mirror_link` values now require the matching publisher-signed checksum/signature sidecars and an independent `opensuse_leapmicro_*_expected_sha256` pin. Query-bearing image URLs must also set explicit `*_checksum_link` and `*_signature_link` values. Put credentials in the architecture-specific `opensuse_leapmicro_x86_mirror_authorization_header` or `opensuse_leapmicro_arm_mirror_authorization_header` only when that architecture's three URLs share one HTTPS origin; authenticated redirects, cross-origin sidecars, URL userinfo credentials, and unsigned/unpinned custom images are rejected.
- **Custom MicroOS Packer mirrors:** custom `opensuse_microos_*_mirror_link` values require explicit matching checksum/signature sidecars and an independent `opensuse_microos_*_expected_sha256` pin. Use the architecture-specific sensitive mirror authorization header only for a single HTTPS origin; redirects, cross-origin sidecars, URL userinfo credentials, and unsigned/unpinned custom images are rejected.
- **Transactional OS SELinux packages:** new k3s/RKE2 nodes with SELinux enabled now require the matching `k3s-selinux` or `rke2-selinux` package and policy to be baked into the selected Leap Micro or MicroOS snapshot. RKE2 bootstrap uses its tar installer so it cannot silently replace the reviewed image package through a live RPM repository. Rebuild custom/legacy snapshots with the current distro-specific Packer matrix before replacing or adding nodes.

### 🚀 New Features

- Static control-plane and agent nodes now advertise dual-stack `node-ip` values that match configured cluster CIDR families, making the existing Cilium IPv6 CIDR inputs plan-validated on the standard private-network topology where validation passes (#2170, #2244, #2245; thanks @mgazza, @bkero).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed non-empty `registries_config` rendering with Terraform/OpenTofu by keeping the conditional result type consistent (#2241, #2242; thanks @prochac).
- Fixed private-only clusters whose public control-plane host is intentionally absent so plans no longer fail with a `coalesce` error (#2248, #2249; thanks @elkh510).
- Fixed new/replaced openSUSE nodes losing SSH access when cloud-init generated a minimal `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` from `ssh_pwauth: false`, which hid the vendor `UsePAM yes` setting (#2252; thanks @steache).
- Fixed IPv6/dual-stack validation so dormant `count = 0` control-plane or agent nodepools do not block otherwise valid plans.
- Fixed private-only NAT-router/control-plane-load-balancer topologies so `join_endpoint_type = "public"` now fails at plan time instead of rendering a null Kubernetes server URL.
- Fixed standard autoscaler-created nodes so they render their private `node-ip` before k3s/RKE2 starts, restoring metrics-server scrapes by `InternalIP`.
- Fixed experimental public-overlay autoscaler bootstrap so it retries and fails closed unless every required public IP family is discovered before writing `node-ip`.
- Fixed repeat Leap Micro snapshot builds by giving each generated image a UTC timestamp plus collision-resistant build ID, allowing operators to refresh stale OS images without deleting snapshots used by running nodes.
- Fixed `scripts/create.sh` so the Leap Micro Packer template and every required trust artifact come from one consistent source snapshot, existing user files remain untouched, and download/Packer failures stop the workflow instead of falling through to success guidance.
- Prevented Packer's Leap Micro provisioning trace from printing the generated root bootstrap password and hash into build logs.
- Authenticated Leap Micro appliances and Rancher SELinux RPMs against vendored full-fingerprint trust anchors, fail-closed key/signature lifecycle checks, exact artifact identity, and reviewed exact-byte SHA-256 pins before Packer writes or installs them.
- Authenticated rolling MicroOS appliances with the same vendored-trust-anchor and independent-digest model, baked the verified distro-specific Rancher SELinux RPM into a committed transactional snapshot, and made automatic image lookup prefer the matching `kube-hetzner/k8s-distro` label while retaining only unlabeled legacy snapshots as fallback.
- Committed final Leap Micro and MicroOS image cleanup inside transactional snapshots so SSH host-key removal, NetworkManager state, and timezone survive image capture without baking regenerated host keys into clones.
- Fixed post-install readiness failing when Helm replaced an addon deployment between the existence and availability checks; the gate now retries that race against its original timeout.
- Prevented RKE2 bootstrap from downloading `rke2-selinux` at runtime; both distributions now fail closed before installation unless the matching verified policy package is already baked into the selected transactional OS snapshot.
- Replaced mutable root execution of `get.k3s.io`/`get.rke2.io` across HCloud, autoscaler, Robot, and generated external-node join paths with pinned official installer bytes. Reviewed channel payloads and explicit operator digests are independently pinned; existing custom exact-version configurations remain compatible through strict parsing of that exact official release's checksum publication. Payloads are verified before installation, inherited installer-path controls are neutralized, baked SELinux preflights remain mandatory, and RKE2 stays on its tar path. The generated external helper also fails closed on missing SELinux policy/context setup and starts the verified agent service.
- Rejected reviewed RKE2 channel releases at plan time when they do not publish artifacts for every active node architecture, while excluding dormant autoscaler pools and preserving custom exact-version checksum fallback.
- Replaced the moving-ref/raw-script setup bootstrap with one immutable Codeload archive whose reviewed SHA-256 is verified before extraction or execution, independently pinned the Packer manifest, and neutralized inherited source-directory overrides.

### 🔧 Changes

- Removed stale `staging` branch guidance from contributor docs, documentation CI triggers, and agent skills; release work now targets explicit release-candidate branches before merge (#2246; thanks @bkero).
- Updated `dflook/terraform-fmt-check` from 2.2.3 to 3.0.0 (#2243; thanks @dependabot).
- Added least-privilege PR gates for Packer formatting/validation, trust-anchor lifecycle, adversarial appliance and installer fixtures, shell analysis, a pinned/checksummed tokenless tfsec scan, and real signed Rancher SELinux RPMs; PR-controlled jobs no longer inherit a writable token or persisted checkout credentials.
- Added optional `k3s_artifact_sha256` and `rke2_artifact_sha256` maps for operators who want independent payload pins on custom exact Kubernetes releases, without adding a plan-time upgrade requirement to existing configurations.
- Protected the release control plane outside mutable workflow files: `master` now requires maintainer PR integration, the HCloud secret environment accepts only default-branch runs with maintainer approval and no admin bypass, `v*` tags are administrator-protected, and release publishing is tag-only.
- Added adversarial live-control contracts that reject release-tag exclusions, extra bypass actors, additional HCloud reviewers or secrets, alternate repositories, and incomplete branch/tag rules instead of accepting merely present controls.
- Enforced the immutable release tree in pull-request CI and tag publication: the tagged tree must descend from the canary-tested functional commit and may differ only at the three reviewed README bootstrap pins.
- Regenerated the public quick-start site from the verified README bootstrap, added a drift/moving-source CI rejection, and routed operator snapshot refreshes through the manifest-bound generated bundle and verified Packer plugin matrix.

### 📚 Documentation

- Cleaned up stale README/site wording around Ansible, MetalLB, and Hetzner firewall defaults (#2247; thanks @SnoozeFreddo).
- Updated v2 → v3 migration and LLM guidance to target v3.1.0/current v3 releases instead of the known-regression v3.0.0 baseline.
- Clarified that the retired KH Assistant Custom GPT is no longer the supported assistant channel; users should install the `/kh-assistant` agent skill suite.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-07-13

### ⚠️ Upgrade Notes

- **Upgrading from v2.x?** This is the v3 line — do not blind-apply. Start with [`MIGRATION.md`](https://github.com/kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner/blob/master/MIGRATION.md) (variable rename map, compatibility freeze table, production safety model with the no-destroy plan gate) and the pinned upgrade guide in [#2232](https://github.com/kube-hetzner/terraform-hcloud-kube-hetzner/issues/2232). The `/migrate-v2-to-v3` agent skill (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) automates the whole flow.
- **Clusters first created with v3.0.0**: static agents were auto-assigned IPs in the control-plane subnet (#2239). Applying v3.0.1 moves each affected agent to its correct nodepool subnet: an in-place private-NIC detach/reattach plus a `node-ip` config rewrite and k3s/RKE2 restart (no server replacement, no data loss; verified live — in our test both agents returned `Ready` on their new IPs without manual intervention, and the follow-up plan converged to zero changes). For production, still treat it as rolling maintenance: cordon/drain one agent, apply with a target on that agent, verify `Ready` on the intended subnet, uncordon, continue. If a node misbehaves after the NIC reattach, reboot it so `kh-rename-interface.service` verifies the interface mapping. Clusters upgraded from v2.x are unaffected (same IP formula as v2 — a no-op).
- **`network_subnet_mode = "shared"` address stability**: shared-mode agent IPs are assigned by a dense cross-pool index. Appending new nodepools at the end is stable, but resizing or removing an *earlier* pool (or toggling a node between primary and external network) renumbers later agents' IPs with the same NIC-reattach behavior described above. Prefer append-only nodepool changes in shared mode; `per_nodepool` mode (the default) keeps v2's stable per-pool addressing.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Static Agent Private IPv4 Placement** - Restored the v2 explicit private-IP formula for primary-network agents so per-nodepool agents honor their subnet (including `subnet_ip_range`) and v2 upgrades keep the same IPs. Shared-subnet mode now assigns a deterministic cross-pool index to prevent duplicate private IPs when node indices repeat across pools. Verified live: v3.0.0 cluster migrated in place, agents moved to their pool subnets, all nodes Ready (#2239, #2240, thanks @boy51, @danmarsic).
- **`scripts/destroy.sh` engine detection** - The teardown wrapper now detects whether a root was initialized with Terraform or OpenTofu from its provider tree instead of always preferring `tofu`, which failed init on terraform-initialized roots. Found by live use.
- **Zero-agent clusters: post-apply plans no longer fail** - On v3.0.0, clusters with `agent_nodepools = []` failed every plan after the first apply with `no change found for terraform_data.agents`, because post-install readiness listed a zero-instance `for_each` resource in `replace_triggered_by`. Readiness now reacts through a single-instance aggregator of agent ids. Upgrading creates one new internal resource and does **not** replace or re-run post-install readiness; future agent additions/removals/replacements re-run only the read-only readiness waits. Fixes #2236, #2238 (#2237, thanks @nikolauspschuetz, @tauhir, @h-mergel).

## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-06

### ⚠️ v3.0.0 Upgrade Notes

This is the v3 major-release line. Before upgrading from any `v2.x` release:

1. Pin and review:
   - Set module version to `3.0.0` (or your targeted v3 tag).
   - Read `docs/v2-to-v3-migration.md` and `MIGRATION.md` end-to-end.
   - Fastest path: with Claude Code or a compatible agent, run the `/migrate-v2-to-v3` agent skill from a checkout of this repo — it applies the variable rename map, runs the protected-infrastructure plan gate, and reviews the upgrade plan with you (see the README section "AI-assisted migration").
2. Run safe upgrade flow:
   - `terraform init -upgrade`
   - `terraform plan`
   - Apply only after reviewing all resource actions.
3. If you use private-network NAT routers created before v2.19.0, check for primary IP replacement and perform state migration first (see migration notes).
4. Networking behavior changed in v3: nodepool `network_id` is active and control-plane attachment behavior is explicit. Cilium public overlay remains an experimental preview gated by `enable_experimental_cilium_public_overlay` until live cross-network datapath validation passes. Prefer blue/green migration for custom/private/Robot/multinetwork topologies; do not apply plans that unexpectedly destroy or recreate network subnets.
5. New clusters and normal in-place v2 upgrades use `network_subnet_mode = "per_nodepool"`, matching the released v2 subnet topology. Optional `network_subnet_mode = "shared"` is for new clusters or intentional topology changes only.
6. Several public inputs were renamed or removed in v3 to clean up the module contract. See `MIGRATION.md` for the old-to-new variable map, especially the inverted positive booleans (`enable_hetzner_csi`, `enable_placement_groups`, `allow_inbound_icmp`, `enable_kube_proxy`, `enable_network_policy`, `enable_selinux`, nodepool `enable_public_ipv4`/`enable_public_ipv6`, autoscaler public-IP flags, and load-balancer enable flags).
7. The v2 `k3s_channel` default was `v1.33`; v3 defaults to the upstream `stable` channel while automatic Kubernetes upgrades still default on. Before the first v3 apply, either pin `k3s_version`, set `k3s_channel = "v1.33"` to keep the v2 minor channel intentionally, or consciously accept following `stable`.
8. Addon version defaults are deterministic in v3. Unset addon version variables now use a reviewed module matrix instead of upstream latest/floating behavior; set `latest` to keep fetching upstream latest releases or following latest Helm charts intentionally.

#### Version Requirements

- Minimum Terraform/OpenTofu version: `1.10.1`
- Minimum hcloud provider version: `1.62.0`

### 💥 Breaking Changes

- **Public input cleanup** - Renamed Kubernetes distribution, install, audit, load-balancer, Robot, CCM, WireGuard, firewall, placement group, public-IP, kube-proxy, SELinux, and storage inputs to a consistent v3 contract. Removed obsolete inputs such as `enable_iscsid`, `extra_kustomize_*`, `autoscaler_labels`, `autoscaler_taints`, and the old CCM deployment-mode switch. See `MIGRATION.md`.
- **Hetzner CCM HelmChart only** - Removed the legacy raw-manifest Hetzner CCM path. v3 always renders the CCM HelmChart manifest and removes old non-Helm CCM objects during addon reconciliation.
- **Existing Network shape** - Replaced `existing_network_id` with `existing_network = { id = 1234567 }`; `network_id = 0` is no longer a valid user value, and omitted/null `network_id` means the primary kube-hetzner Network.
- **Nodepool network behavior** - Agent and autoscaler `network_id` values are now active. Control planes stay on the primary Network and do not accept `network_id`.
- **Subnet allocation modes** - New v3 clusters and normal in-place v2 upgrades use `network_subnet_mode = "per_nodepool"`, matching the released v2 subnet topology. Added optional `network_subnet_mode = "shared"` for compact new-cluster layouts that intentionally use one shared agent subnet and one shared control-plane subnet.
- **Minimum tool versions** - Terraform/OpenTofu `>= 1.10.1` and hcloud provider `>= 1.62.0` are required.
- **Default/architecture changes** - New nodes default to Leap Micro, architecture selection is consolidated into `enabled_architectures`, and default behavior moved to explicit positive booleans.

### 🚀 New Features

- **Declarative Node Annotations** - Added create-only Kubernetes Node annotations on control-plane, agent, per-node agent/control-plane overrides, and autoscaler nodepools. Non-empty maps render a node-local cloud-init systemd oneshot that waits for k3s/RKE2, uses the node kubelet kubeconfig, and patches only its own Node; empty maps render no unit or payload, preserving existing cluster user-data. This covers Longhorn default-disk bootstrap annotations and autoscaler-created nodes without adding an ongoing reconciler (#2198, requested by @clemlesne).
- **Optional Upgrade Tooling Deployment** - Added `enable_kured` and `enable_system_upgrade_controller` toggles for clusters that manage reboot orchestration or system-upgrade-controller externally. Disabling these flags omits the resources from future kustomization applies but does not prune already-deployed kured/system-upgrade-controller objects from existing clusters; remove those manually if needed. The k3s and RKE2 kustomization trigger state includes these toggles and the rendered addon payload, so future toggle flips rerun the relevant provisioners (#2223).
- **Per-Set User Kustomization Apply Flags** - Added `user_kustomizations[*].apply_options` for passing validated `kubectl apply` flags such as server-side apply to individual ordered user kustomization sets (#2218).
- **Raw kube-apiserver Args Passthrough** - Added `kube_apiserver_args` (list of strings, default `[]`) to append arbitrary apiserver flags to the control-plane `config.yaml` `kube-apiserver-arg` (e.g. `service-account-issuer` / `service-account-jwks-uri` for OIDC workload identity) for options without a dedicated module variable. Applied in-place via the existing config-update provisioner (k3s/rke2 service restart, no control-plane node recreation); entries must omit the leading `--`, enforced by input validation.
- **Leap Micro Support (Stable Default OS)** - Added `os` selector for control plane, agent, and autoscaler nodepools (plus per-node agent overrides). New nodepools default to `leapmicro`; existing nodepools remain on MicroOS by default on upgrade to avoid recreation. New variables: `leapmicro_x86_snapshot_id`, `leapmicro_arm_snapshot_id`. Added packer template `packer-template/hcloud-leapmicro-snapshots.pkr.hcl` and automatic OS detection via the `kube-hetzner/os` server label.
- **Agent Floating IP Family Selection** - Added `floating_ip_type` (`ipv4`/`ipv6`) to agent nodepools and node overrides, including IPv6-aware NetworkManager reconfiguration logic.
- **Cilium Egress Gateway HA Reconciler** - New `cilium_egress_gateway_ha_enabled` option to deploy a lightweight controller that keeps labeled `CiliumEgressGatewayPolicy` objects pinned to a Ready egress node.
- **Cilium v3 Dual-Stack Defaults** - Cilium now renders IPv4/IPv6 Helm values from the configured cluster CIDRs and keeps kube-proxy replacement tied to `enable_kube_proxy = false` (#2170, #2178).
- **Cilium Gateway API Support** - Added `cilium_gateway_api_enabled` to install standard Gateway API CRDs for the selected Cilium line, enable Cilium `gatewayAPI.enabled`, and wire cert-manager Gateway API support. Added `examples/cilium-gateway-api`.
- **Cilium Multinetwork Public Overlay Preview** - Added gated `multinetwork_mode = "cilium_public_overlay"` plumbing for Cilium-only clusters spanning multiple Hetzner Networks, including public IPv4/IPv6/dual-stack transport selection, WireGuard/tunnel defaults, public load-balancer targeting, control-plane fanout removal, and one Cluster Autoscaler Deployment per effective `network_id`. This path now requires `enable_experimental_cilium_public_overlay = true` and is not production-supported until the live datapath E2E passes.
- **Tailscale Node Transport** - Added opt-in `node_transport_mode = "tailscale"` for secure single-network clusters and supported private multinetwork scale-out. The module can bootstrap Tailscale, use MagicDNS for Terraform/kubeconfig access, optionally advertise each node's Hetzner private `/32` route with subnet-route SNAT disabled, keep Kubernetes node IPs on Hetzner private addresses, validate Tailnet/firewall/CNI/load-balancer constraints at plan time with explicit nodepool `network_scope`, and render autoscaler nodes with per-Network Tailscale bootstrap. Flannel is the first supported CNI; Cilium remains gated as experimental for this transport until live datapath coverage promotes it.
- **Embedded Registry Mirror** - Added `embedded_registry_mirror` for trusted large clusters, enabling k3s/RKE2's embedded Spegel mirror while preserving user `registries_config` entries.
- **Placement Group Auto-Sharding** - Count-based nodepools without an explicit `placement_group` now shard implicit Hetzner spread placement groups every 10 servers; explicit placement groups still fail validation above Hetzner's 10-server limit.
- **Large-Scale Tailscale Examples** - Added +100-node and 10,000-total-node Tailscale node-transport reference examples that account for Hetzner Network attachment limits, placement-group limits, autoscaler shards, and the public-IP/Tailnet exposure model.
- **Endpoint Introspection Outputs** - Added outputs for the effective kubeconfig API endpoint, node join endpoint, node transport mode, and Tailscale MagicDNS hostnames.
- **v3 Topology Recommendations** - Added `docs/v3-topology-recommendations.md` covering the recommended dev, HA, NAT, Tailscale, +100 node, 10k reference, RKE2, Cilium dual-stack, Gateway API, Robot/vSwitch, and registry mirror shapes.
- **Multiple Attached Volumes Per Node** - Added `attached_volumes` support for control plane and agent nodepools (including per-node overrides) to provision and mount multiple Hetzner Volumes per node.
- **NAT Router Customization** - Added NAT-router `extra_runcmd` and `use_private_nat_router_bastion` support for private-network bastion hardening (#2165, #2166).
- **External Overlay Access Hooks** - Added and documented the provider-agnostic `node_connection_overrides` pattern for Tailscale, ZeroTier, Cloudflare WARP, and similar overlays. Use this for user-owned operator access or post-bootstrap overlay features; use `node_transport_mode = "tailscale"` when Tailscale should be the official Kubernetes node transport.
- **Per-Nodepool Snapshot Overrides** - Added `os_snapshot_id` overrides to control-plane and agent nodepools and node overrides (#2158).
- **Plan-Time Configuration Guardrails** - Added Terraform/OpenTofu cross-variable validation for architecture toggles, network regions/CIDRs, nodepool topology, load balancers, autoscaler settings, CCM/Robot, Cilium-only features, firewall sources, and multi-volume attachments so invalid combinations fail during `terraform plan`.
- **Robot vSwitch Route Exposure Control** - Added `expose_routes_to_vswitch` to manage Hetzner Cloud route exposure to coupled Robot vSwitches when kube-hetzner creates the primary Network.
- **v2-to-v3 Migration Assistant** - Added a read-only audit script, project skill, and migration playbook for guided v2 configuration rewrites, plan review, and state-safety checks.
- **OpenTofu Support** - Documented OpenTofu as a supported engine and expanded Hetzner CI presets to run both Terraform and OpenTofu apply/health/destroy paths.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Shell-Safe User Input Hardening** - SSH keys, Kubernetes install environment values, install exec/version inputs, Cluster Autoscaler extra args, and user kustomization template filenames are now validated or YAML-encoded before root bootstrap/rendering. Unsafe quotes, newlines, shell metacharacters, YAML syntax, and path traversal in those inputs are intentionally rejected.
- **Kubeconfig Structural Rename Safety** - Rewrote generated kubeconfig endpoint and identity renames through parsed YAML so certificate blobs and other fields containing `default` are no longer mutated by global string replacement.
- **Ingress Load Balancer Destroy Cleanup** - Added fail-open destroy-time cleanup for module-managed ingress LoadBalancer Services across k3s and RKE2 so Hetzner CCM removes the adopted ingress load balancer before Terraform tears down nodes and network attachments. Found by the v3 live gate after a surviving nginx LB blocked network/subnet destroy.
- **Ingress Load Balancer Destroy Retry** - CI now retries `terraform destroy` once to absorb the known already-detaching race between Hetzner CCM deleting an adopted ingress LoadBalancer and Terraform detaching the same LB network attachment; plan 011 tracks the longer-term single-ownership design.
- **Ingress Hook Bootstrap Scheduling** - Added hook-scoped bootstrap tolerations to ingress-nginx admission patch jobs and the HAProxy CRD hook so managed ingress Helm installs can finish when v3 bootstraps kustomizations before agent nodes join. Controller Deployments intentionally keep their existing scheduling semantics. Found by the live CI gate via the nginx admission hook deadlock.
- **Ingress Load Balancer Annotation Rendering** - Fixed ingress-nginx, Traefik, and HAProxy Helm values templates so Hetzner Load Balancer adoption annotations stay nested at the chart-specific Service annotation path instead of being stripped to the values document root by Terraform template trim markers. Found by the v3 CI gate, with a new plan-time semantic contract for the rendered values.
- **NAT Router Reconciliation Safety** - Reworked the NAT router reconcile provisioner so fresh v3 routers no longer write script text into `sshd_config.d/kube-hetzner.conf` through unterminated nested heredocs, preventing sshd from failing and permanently cutting off the router. Found by the v3 live gate.
- **Size-Aware Control-Plane Kubelet Reservations** - Control-plane nodepools that still use the legacy kubelet reservation default now compute `kube-reserved` memory from the selected Hetzner server type, preventing small RKE2 control planes such as `cx23` from rejecting scheduler static pods during bootstrap. Added an RKE2 validation guardrail for parseable reservations above 50% of server RAM. Credits the live-gate finding from fresh v3 RKE2 cluster validation.
- **SSH Authorized Keys Upgrade Safety** - Host SSH reconciliation now preserves out-of-band root authorized keys by default while revoking module-managed keys removed from `ssh_public_key` or `ssh_additional_public_keys`. Set `ssh_authorized_keys_exclusive = true` for strict replacement with only module-managed keys.
- **NAT Router Failover Peer Scoping** - NAT routers now carry the standard cluster identity labels and redundant failover peer discovery filters by `role=nat_router,cluster=<cluster_name>`, preventing foreign NAT routers in the same Hetzner project from being selected.
- **Agent Bootstrap Ordering** - Ordered agents after k3s/RKE2 kustomization bootstrap, moved post-install readiness waits after agent join, and kept observable agent start failures for default multi-node clusters (#2215, #2220, #2221).
- **Control Plane LB Health Check** - Kept the control-plane load balancer health check on HTTP protocol with TLS enabled for the Kubernetes `/readyz` endpoint, avoiding invalid Hetzner `https` protocol validation failures (#2188, #2199, #2200, #2205).
- **Autoscaler Large Configs and DRA RBAC** - Cluster Autoscaler now reads the generated Hetzner cluster config from a Secret-backed file, uses server-side apply for its manifest, and has read-only RBAC for Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation resources (#2194, #2195, #2202).
- **Kured on Tainted Nodes** - Added a universal toleration to Kured so OS reboot management still runs on tainted nodes (#2196).
- **Subnet Validation Contract** - Kept NAT router and vSwitch subnet-index upper bounds conditional on those features being enabled, preserving small `subnet_count` validation compatibility while still failing invalid enabled configurations (#2197).
- **External Manifest Fetch Resilience** - Added retry blocks to GitHub and public-IP HTTP data sources so transient TLS handshake timeouts do not fail plans, applies, or destroys.
- **Autoscaler CA Root Loading** - Removed the `/etc/ssl/certs` hostPath mount from Cluster Autoscaler so RKE2/Leap Micro clusters use the image's bundled CA roots instead of hitting host certificate directory permission failures.
- **Terraform 1.15 Validation Compatibility** - Moved cross-variable and local-dependent module contract checks from input-variable validation blocks into a hard `terraform_data.validation_contract` precondition surface, preserving plan-time failures while allowing Terraform 1.15.0 to initialize and validate the module.
- **Tailscale Volume Provisioning Ordering** - Agent Longhorn and attached-volume configuration now waits for Tailscale agent bootstrap before using Tailnet MagicDNS SSH targets.
- **Tailscale Auth-Key Ergonomics** - `auth_key` mode no longer advertises kube-hetzner tags by default, so simple pre-auth keys work without Tailnet `tagOwners`; tagged nodes remain an explicit opt-in and OAuth mode now validates that tag-scoped auth is configured.
- **Tailscale Single-Network Ergonomics** - Tailscale mode now cleanly supports ordinary single-network clusters: node-private route advertisement can be disabled when no `network_scope = "external"` nodepools are used, private control-plane Load Balancers are allowed, and private managed ingress Load Balancers are rejected only for external-network scale-out.
- **Tailscale Same-Root Network Validation** - Tailscale static agent and autoscaler nodepools now use explicit `network_scope = "primary" | "external"` intent, so invalid same-root external Network configurations fail during `terraform plan` even when `network_id` is not known until apply.
- **Placement Group Disable/Limit Semantics** - `enable_placement_groups = false` now stops creating unused placement-group resources, and plan-time validation enforces Hetzner's 50-placement-group project limit before large static topologies hit provider errors.
- **Same-Root Tailscale External Networks** - In Tailscale transport mode, nodepool `network_id` values can come from Hetzner Network resources created in the same Terraform root because control planes no longer need apply-time fanout attachments to every external agent Network.
- **Cloud-Init Health-Checker Race** - Host and autoscaler cloud-init now masks Leap Micro/MicroOS `health-checker.service` before `cloud-final` to prevent a systemd ordering-cycle race that can skip first-boot Kubernetes bootstrap on autoscaled nodes.
- **Cilium Multinetwork Bootstrap** - Public-overlay clusters now allow restricted outbound Kubernetes API traffic and keep Hetzner CCM network-aware while route reconciliation stays disabled, so control planes can remain on their private node identity and external-network agents can join over the public overlay.
- **Cilium Default Bootstrap** - Cilium now enables eBPF masquerading only when kube-proxy replacement is enabled, matching Cilium's BPF NodePort dependency and preventing default Cilium clusters from CrashLooping on startup.
- **Interface Rename Self-Heal** - Added a boot-time `kh-rename-interface.service` and stale udev MAC refresh so private NIC renames survive MAC changes and reboots (#2182).
- **User Kustomization Redeploys** - User kustomization uploads and deploys now rerun after first control-plane replacement (#2160).
- **Custom Ingress Mode** - `ingress_controller = "custom"` now skips managed ingress Service lookup/wait logic (#2173).
- **Autoscaler Without Public IPv4** - Autoscaler cloud-init now routes IPv4 through the private gateway when public IPv4 is disabled, while keeping public IPv6 routing when enabled (#2154).
- **Hetzner CCM Dual-Stack Address Family** - Hetzner CCM now keeps route reconciliation on the IPv4 pod CIDR and sets `HCLOUD_INSTANCES_ADDRESS_FAMILY` for IPv6/dual-stack clusters (#2170).
- **Cilium Egress Gateway Validation** - Enforces `enable_kube_proxy = false` when Cilium Egress Gateway is enabled, matching Cilium's kube-proxy replacement requirement (#2178).
- **Cilium Egress Gateway HA Reconciler** - Treats `CiliumEgressGatewayPolicy` as cluster-scoped when retargeting labeled policies (#2178).
- **Upgrade-Safe Ingress Namespace Defaults** - Restored legacy nginx default namespace (`nginx`) to avoid Helm ownership conflicts during upgrades from v2.19.x clusters.
- **CCM Ownership Compatibility** - Keeps Hetzner CCM on the existing HelmChart manifest flow, avoiding release-name collisions with already-installed CCM chart instances.
- **CCM Helm Migration Cleanup** - v3 now removes the full legacy non-Helm Hetzner CCM RBAC surface before installing the Helm-managed CCM, while preserving Helm-owned CCM resources on later applies.
- **Upgrade-Safe Hetzner SSH Key State** - Preserves the v2-managed `hcloud_ssh_key.k3s` resource during v3 upgrades instead of auto-adopting the same key through a data source and planning key deletion.
- **Addon Manifest Fetch Stability** - Terraform now fetches kured and system-upgrade-controller release manifests and uploads them as local kustomize resources, avoiding control-plane kustomize failures on GitHub release-asset URLs.
- **Subnet Topology Compatibility** - Restored per-nodepool control-plane/agent subnet resources and nodepool subnet attachment while keeping auto-assigned private IPv4 behavior.
- **RKE2 SELinux Apply Parity** - Wired RKE2 server/agent install flows to apply the `rke2-selinux` policy module when available and added safe post-install `restorecon` relabeling for RKE2 binaries.
- **LeapMicro SELinux Snapshot Matrix (k3s/rke2 x x86/arm)** - LeapMicro packer now builds distro-specific SELinux snapshots (`selinux_package_to_install`), labels snapshots with `kube-hetzner/k8s-distro` and architecture, and auto-selection now matches `kubernetes_distribution` to prevent k3s/rke2 SELinux RPM conflicts.
- **MicroOS Packer SELinux Scope** - Removed `rke2-selinux` preinstall from the MicroOS packer template; it now only preinstalls and locks `k3s-selinux`.
- **LeapMicro SELinux Policy De-duplication** - Moved `k8s_custom_policies` into a shared template consumed by both host and autoscaler cloud-init paths to prevent policy drift.
- **RKE2 SELinux Enforcing Guardrail** - Added an explicit enforcing-mode validation that fails provisioning if the `rke2` SELinux module is still not loaded.
- **Longhorn iSCSI SELinux Capability** - Added `iscsid_t` `dac_override` permission to the shared kube-hetzner SELinux module.
- **RKE2 TLS SAN Endpoint Parity** - `control_plane_config_rke2` now includes `local.kubeconfig_server_address` in `tls-san`, preserving SAN coverage for NAT-router/private-LB kubeconfig endpoints.
- **Hetzner CI LeapMicro Snapshot Gate** - Hetzner test prerequisites now accept LeapMicro snapshot secrets (with MicroOS fallback) instead of requiring MicroOS-only secrets.
- **Autoscaler Nodepool Parity/Validation** - Added autoscaler nodepool validation guards (unique names, integer min/max bounds, taint effect and swap/zram format checks) and aligned RKE2 autoscaled node labeling/taint rendering with the k3s autoscaler path.
- **RKE2 User Kustomizations** - Switched user kustomization apply path to distribution-aware `kubectl_cli`, fixing apply failures in RKE2 clusters.
- **extra_network_ids Attachment** - Wired `extra_network_ids` into host provisioning so additional Hetzner networks are actually attached to control-plane and agent nodes.
- **Connection Override Consistency** - Unified control-plane and agent `node_connection_overrides` resolution so provisioning and follow-up operations honor the same override key strategy (including suffixed node names).
- **RKE2 TLS SAN Parity (No LB)** - Added kubeconfig/control-plane advertised endpoints to RKE2 non-LB TLS SAN generation to prevent certificate mismatch on custom kubeconfig server addresses.
- **Control Plane Bootstrap Config Files** - First-node k3s/RKE2 bootstrap now installs authentication and audit policy config files before starting the API server when the matching API-server args are enabled.
- **RKE2 First Bootstrap Parity** - RKE2 first bootstrap now respects `enable_selinux` and uses the effective kubeconfig/control-plane endpoints in its initial `tls-san` list, matching steady-state config.
- **Attached Volume Mount Safety** - Attached control-plane and agent volumes now rerun mount configuration on size changes, resize XFS via mount path, and persist fstab entries by filesystem UUID instead of mutable device paths.
- **K3s Channel Guardrail** - Default `k3s_channel` now uses the live `stable` channel, and plan-time validation rejects minor live channels except the explicit `v1.33` v2-preservation path unless an exact `k3s_version`/`rke2_version` is set, avoiding broken upstream minor-channel installer resolution.
- **API Port Consistency** - k3s first bootstrap now honors `kubernetes_api_port`, the control-plane LB health check/backend follows the configured listener port, IPv6 kubeconfig endpoints are bracketed correctly, and RKE2 now rejects unsupported non-6443 API port settings.
- **RKE2 Apply Parity** - RKE2 kustomization triggers now include CCM values and system-upgrade drain/eviction/window settings, readiness waits evaluate dynamically, deployment/job waits match k3s, and RKE2 secret deployment uses the shared file-based secret path instead of shell argv literals.
- **Node Route Robustness** - Host cloud-init now handles public-IPv6-only nodes by routing IPv4 through the private gateway while preserving public IPv6 routing, matching autoscaler behavior.
- **Leap Micro First-Boot Readiness** - Host provisioning now resets and tolerates the known non-critical `transactional-update.service` first-boot failure while still blocking on other failed systemd units.
- **Upgrade-Safe Detection/Provisioning** - Existing hyphenated nodepool names without random suffixes are detected correctly for OS defaults, NAT routers no longer recreate for image/user-data drift, and RKE2 autoscaler SSH keys use the normalized authorized-key list.
- **RKE2 Replacement/Reapply Safety** - RKE2 first-node bootstrap now retriggers on first control-plane replacement, and RKE2 addon application hashes the rendered kustomization payload so template/resource toggles are reapplied.
- **Per-Network Route/Floating IP Detection** - Install-time private-route repair and floating IP public-NIC detection now use each node's actual private network CIDR/gateway instead of the primary cluster network.
- **NAT Router Config Reconciliation** - Existing NAT routers now reconcile cloud-init-owned SSH, DNS, iptables, and keepalived config through Terraform provisioners while connection-critical SSH/user/key changes force router replacement.
- **Hetzner CI Presets** - CI preset tests now use a compact local-checkout fixture, sanitize preset-derived cluster names, and cover Terraform apply, Kubernetes health checks, and Terraform destroy for default, nginx, and RKE2 presets.
- **RKE2 Registry Bootstrap** - Initial cloud-init now writes `registries_config` to `/etc/rancher/rke2/registries.yaml` for RKE2 clusters instead of the k3s path, so custom registries are available before first RKE2 start.

### 🔧 Changes
- **SSH Port Validation** - Tightened `ssh_port` input validation so port `0` and fractional values fail early.
- **SMB CSI Chart Pinning** - Pinned the `csi_driver_smb_version` default to reviewed chart `1.20.3` while preserving `"*"` as an explicit floating opt-in, and removed the unused NFS CSI template scaffold.
- 🔧 **Disabled Addon Fetch Gating** - `enable_kured = false` and `enable_system_upgrade_controller = false` now skip the corresponding GitHub release/manifest HTTP data sources entirely; disabled clusters may see one idempotent kustomization re-run as addon trigger state normalizes disabled remote manifest inputs to empty strings.
- **Sensitive Kustomization Backup** - The generated kustomization backup now uses Terraform's sensitive local-file resource so Rancher registration manifest URLs are treated as sensitive on disk; rotate any Rancher registration token that may have been written by an earlier backup.

- **Hetzner CI Orphan Sweeper** - Added a scheduled/manual sweeper for stale `kh-ci-*` Hetzner CI resources. It skips active Hetzner test runs, defaults to dry-run, and requires prefix-anchored names plus age gates before deletion.
- **Render Harness CI Gate** - Added a hermetic rendered-template harness and negative validation-contract plan fixture so Helm values, ingress LB annotations, cloud-init YAML, shell templates, and key v3 validation preconditions are checked before live cluster gates.
- **Explicit Provider Constraints** - Pinned the previously implicit Kubernetes, Helm, Random, and CloudInit provider requirements and expanded CI validation across Terraform 1.10.5, 1.14.9, 1.15.0, and OpenTofu 1.11.6.
- **iSCSI Daemon Defaults** - `iscsid` is now enabled on all nodes by default, and the `enable_iscsid` input was removed.
- **Cilium Default Version** - Updated the default Cilium version to `1.19.3` so v3 defaults align with the current Gateway API-supported Cilium line.
- **Gateway API CRD Version Override** - Restored the `gateway_api_version` input for users who need to pin the standard Gateway API CRD bundle independently of `cilium_version`, matching the v2 pinning capability. The default empty value keeps v3's Cilium-derived CRD version behavior.
- **Primary IP Provider Cleanup** - Removed now-unused `assignee_type = "server"` attributes from hcloud Primary IP resources and raised the hcloud provider minimum to `1.62.0`.
- **Cloudflare Zero Trust Support Boundary** - Documented Cloudflare Access/Tunnel as a user-managed external access pattern for kube API, SSH, Rancher, and ingress, while explicitly keeping Cloudflare Mesh/WARP out of the v3 node-transport support contract. Use Tailscale for supported secure node transport.
- **Release Attribution Robustness** - Release workflow now maps commits to associated PR authors (including squash merges) when generating contributor credits, so original implementers are preserved.
- **v3 Migration Skill Update** - Updated the repo-local migrate-v2-to-v3 agent skill with live-upgrade lessons, the destroy retry caveat, and the final Tailscale support wording.

## [2.21.0] - 2026-07-04

### ⚠️ Upgrade Notes

- **One-time kustomization re-run**: the kustomization trigger state now includes the new deploy toggles and the rendered `kustomization.yaml` hash, so the first `terraform apply` after upgrading re-runs the post-install kustomization once (an idempotent `kubectl apply -k` — no resources are destroyed or recreated). Verified on a live fresh-apply gate: all nodes Ready, upgrade tooling deployed under defaults, toggle flips correctly re-run the kustomization.
- Both new features preserve existing behavior at their defaults (`kustomize_apply_options = ["--wait=true"]`, both toggles `true`).

### 🚀 New Features

- **Configurable User Kustomization Apply Flags** - Added `kustomize_apply_options` for passing validated `kubectl apply` flags such as server-side apply to user kustomizations. Defaults to `["--wait=true"]` to preserve existing behavior (#2218).
- **Optional Upgrade Tooling Deployment** - Added `enable_kured` and `enable_system_upgrade_controller` toggles for clusters that manage reboot orchestration or system-upgrade-controller externally. Disabling these flags omits the resources from future kustomization applies but does not prune already-deployed kured/system-upgrade-controller objects from existing clusters; remove those manually if needed. The kustomization trigger state now includes these toggles and the rendered `kustomization.yaml` hash, so existing clusters will see one idempotent `kubectl apply -k` re-run on upgrade; future toggle flips correctly re-run the kustomization provisioners (#2223).

---

## [2.20.1] - 2026-07-04

### ⚠️ Upgrade Notes

- This is a pure bug-fix patch: existing clusters should see a **no-op `terraform plan`** after upgrading (verified against v2.20.0 — no resource changes, no recreation). The agent-startup and kustomization fixes take effect on fresh applies and node replacements; the SELinux fix applies to newly provisioned/replaced nodes only.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Traefik Gateway API CRDs** - Install the Kubernetes Gateway API standard CRDs before Traefik when `traefik_provider_kubernetes_gateway_enabled` is enabled, preventing Helm install failures for `GatewayClass` and `Gateway` resources (#2211).
- **Agent Startup Race on Fresh Deploys** - Agent nodes now start only after the kustomization that deploys the Hetzner CCM, fixing consistent `exit 124` timeouts on fresh single-apply deployments. The agent start is also observable now: on failure it dumps `systemctl status` and journal output instead of failing silently (#2215, #2220).
- **User Kustomization Failures No Longer Masked** - A failed `kubectl apply -k` in the user kustomization deploy now fails the apply loudly instead of being masked by trailing `extra_kustomize_deployment_commands` (#2225).
- **Packer Snapshot Build Overrides** - The MicroOS snapshot template now exposes `x86_server_type`, `x86_location`, `arm_server_type`, and `arm_location` packer variables, so builds can be pointed at available server types/locations with `-var` instead of editing the template when Hetzner capacity shifts (#2214).
- **SELinux: CSI Liveness Probes** - Added `allow container_t kernel_t:tcp_socket { read write }` to the kube-hetzner SELinux policy, fixing hcloud-csi-driver (and similar CSI) crash-loops caused by liveness-probe denials under enforcing SELinux. Applies to newly provisioned/replaced nodes; on existing nodes either replace nodes or apply the module manually as described in #2203.

---

## [2.20.0] - 2026-06-02

### ⚠️ Upgrade Notes

- **Cluster Autoscaler Config File** - Autoscaler nodepools now mount the generated Hetzner cluster config through a Secret-backed file to avoid Kubernetes annotation size failures on large configurations. If `autoscaler_nodepools` is enabled and you override `cluster_autoscaler_version`, use `v1.33.0` or newer. The module default remains compatible.

### 🚀 New Features

- **Autoscaler DRA Permissions** - Added read-only Cluster Autoscaler RBAC for Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation resources (`deviceclasses`, `resourceclaims`, `resourceslices`) (#2202).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Control Plane LB Health Check** - Fixed the Hetzner control-plane load balancer health check to use HTTP protocol with TLS enabled for the Kubernetes `/readyz` endpoint, avoiding invalid `https` protocol validation failures (#2188, #2199, #2200, #2205).
- **Terraform 1.11 Null Validation Compatibility** - Fixed null-safe NAT router and flannel backend validation paths so Terraform 1.11 can initialize and validate default configurations without `nat_router` or `flannel_backend` set (#2197).
- **Subnet Validation Contract** - Preserved hard validation for `subnet_amount` and `network_ipv4_cidr` cross-variable constraints without using Terraform variable validations that fail during module initialization under Terraform 1.11.
- **NAT Router Primary IP Drift** - Removed the deprecated fixed `assignee_type` argument from NAT router primary IP resources to avoid provider warnings and future drift (#2201).
- **MicroOS Snapshot Lookup** - Made default MicroOS snapshot lookup architecture-aware so ARM autoscaler pools do not depend on x86-only snapshot data sources (#2206).
- **Autoscaler Large Configs** - Moved large autoscaler cluster config JSON out of the Deployment environment and into a mounted Secret file, and switched apply to server-side field management to avoid annotation size limits (#2194, #2195).
- **Kured on Tainted Nodes** - Added a universal toleration to Kured so OS reboot management still runs on tainted nodes (#2196).
- **Kustomize Release Assets** - Upload Kured, system-upgrade-controller, and non-Helm CCM release manifests locally before running Kustomize, avoiding remote-base build failures on nodes without sufficient network access (#2186).

### 📚 Documentation

- Clarified Cluster Autoscaler scale-down behavior for pods using local storage and the safe overrides available for intentional eviction (#2187).
- Clarified that `ingress_controller = "nginx"` installs Kubernetes ingress-nginx, not the F5 NGINX Ingress Controller; use `ingress_controller = "none"` when installing F5 independently (#2204).
- Fixed the `kube.tf.example` HA control-plane example so every nodepool name is unique and the example validates as a root Terraform configuration.

## [2.19.3] - 2026-04-25

### 📋 v2.19.3 Patch Release

This is a patch release for the v2.19 series focused on upgrade-safe reliability fixes.

**Patch fixes:**
- **Terraform Legacy Module Regression** - Removed the child-module GitHub provider configuration that prevented callers from using `count`, `for_each`, or `depends_on`; release lookups now use unauthenticated HTTP requests instead (#2155).
- **SSH Public Key Normalization** - Trimmed trailing whitespace from SSH public keys to avoid Hetzner provider apply inconsistencies when users pass keys with `file(...)`.
- **NAT Router Validation** - Made NAT router validations null-safe when `nat_router = null` (#2152, #2153).
- **Autoscaler ZRAM Bootstrap** - Fixed autoscaler nodes hanging in cloud-init when `zram_size` is configured (#2161, #2162).
- **NAT Router Fail2ban** - Fixed the Debian 12 SSH jail by applying journald/systemd backend support and starting/restarting fail2ban during NAT router provisioning (#2163).
- **MicroOS Snapshot Growth** - Reduced snapper timeline retention to avoid disk pressure on small nodes (#2167).
- **Longhorn Volume Reconfiguration** - Re-runs Longhorn volume setup on volume identity/size/path/fstype changes, grows filesystems correctly, and stores fstab entries by filesystem UUID instead of mutable Hetzner volume device IDs (#2174, #2180).
- **System Upgrade Plans** - Re-applies system-upgrade-controller Plans when `system_upgrade_use_drain` or `system_upgrade_enable_eviction` changes after initial provisioning (#2172).
- **Control Plane LB Health Check** - Added an explicit HTTPS `/readyz` health check for the control-plane load balancer while keeping the service TCP passthrough (#2176).
- **Hetzner CSI Values Docs** - Documented existing `hetzner_csi_values` support for custom CSI Helm values (#2168).
- **Longhorn RWX Guidance** - Documented the upstream Longhorn RWX/NFS 4.1 issue and the NFS 4.0 workaround (#2169).

---

## [2.19.0] - 2026-02-01

### ⚠️ Upgrade Notes (from v2.18.x)

#### NAT Router Users (created before v2.19.0)

If you created a NAT router **before v2.19.0** (when the hcloud provider used the now-deprecated `datacenter` attribute), you may see Terraform wanting to recreate your NAT router primary IPs. This would result in new IP addresses.

**To check if you're affected**, run `terraform plan` and look for changes to:
- `hcloud_primary_ip.nat_router_primary_ipv4`
- `hcloud_primary_ip.nat_router_primary_ipv6`

**If Terraform shows replacement**, you have two options:

1. **Allow the recreation** (simplest, but IPs will change):
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

2. **Migrate state manually** (preserves IPs):
   ```bash
   # Remove old state entries
   terraform state rm 'module.kube-hetzner.hcloud_primary_ip.nat_router_primary_ipv4[0]'
   terraform state rm 'module.kube-hetzner.hcloud_primary_ip.nat_router_primary_ipv6[0]'

   # Import with current IPs (get IDs from Hetzner Cloud Console)
   terraform import 'module.kube-hetzner.hcloud_primary_ip.nat_router_primary_ipv4[0]' <ipv4-id>
   terraform import 'module.kube-hetzner.hcloud_primary_ip.nat_router_primary_ipv6[0]' <ipv6-id>

   terraform apply
   ```

#### Version Requirements

- Minimum Terraform version: `1.10.1`
- Minimum hcloud provider version: `1.59.0`

### 🚀 New Features

- **Hetzner Robot Integration** - Manage dedicated Robot servers via vSwitch and Cloud Controller Manager. New variables: `robot_ccm_enabled`, `robot_user`, `robot_password`, `vswitch_id`, `vswitch_subnet_index` (#1916)
- **Audit Logging** - Kubernetes audit logs with configurable policy via `k3s_audit_policy_config` and log rotation settings (#1825)
- **Control Plane Endpoint** - New `control_plane_endpoint` variable for stable external API server endpoint (e.g., external load balancers) (#1911)
- **NAT Router Control Plane Access** - Automatic port 6443 forwarding on NAT router when `control_plane_lb_enable_public_interface` is false (#2015)
- **Smaller Networks** - New `subnet_amount` variable enables networks smaller than /16 (#1971)
- **Custom Subnet Ranges** - Added `subnet_ip_range` to agent_nodepools for manual CIDR assignment (#1903)
- **Autoscaler Swap/ZRAM** - Added `swap_size` and `zram_size` support for autoscaler node pools (#2008)
- **Autoscaler Resources** - New `cluster_autoscaler_replicas`, `cluster_autoscaler_resource_limits`, `cluster_autoscaler_resource_values` (#2025)
- **Flannel Backend** - New `flannel_backend` variable to override flannel backend (wireguard-native, host-gw, etc.)
- **Cilium XDP Acceleration** - New `cilium_loadbalancer_acceleration_mode` variable (native, best-effort, disabled)
- **K3s v1.35 Support** - Added support for k3s v1.35 channel (#2029)
- **Packer Enhancements** - Configurable `kernel_type`, `sysctl_config_file`, and `timezone` for MicroOS snapshots (#2009, #2010)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Audit Policy Bastion Connection** _(v2.19.1)_ - Fixed missing bastion SSH settings in `audit_policy` provisioner, enabling audit policy deployment for NAT router / private network setups (#2042)
- **Longhorn Hotfix Tag Guidance** - Clarified `longhorn_version` as chart version and documented `longhorn_merge_values` for targeted Longhorn image hotfix tags (e.g. manager/instance-manager) (#2054)
- **Traefik v34 Compatibility** - Fixed HTTP to HTTPS redirection config for Traefik Helm Chart v34+ (#2028)
- **NAT Router IP Drift** - Fixed infinite replacement cycle by migrating from deprecated `datacenter` to `location` (#2021)
- **SELinux YAML Parsing** - Fixed cloud-init SCHEMA_ERROR caused by improper YAML formatting of SELinux policy
- **SELinux Missing Rules** - Added rules for JuiceFS (sock_file write) and SigNoz (blk_file getattr)
- **Kured Version Null** - Fixed potential null value issues with `kured_version` logic (#2032)

### 🔧 Changes

- **Default K3s Channel** - Bumped from the v1.33 minor channel to the upstream `stable` channel after upstream minor-channel resolution stopped being a reliable install-time contract (#2030)
- **Default System Upgrade Controller** - Bumped to v0.18.0
- **SELinux Policy Extraction** - Moved to dedicated template file for maintainability
- **terraform_data Migration** - Migrated from null_resource to terraform_data with automatic state migration (#1548)
- **remote-exec Refactor** - Improved provisioner compatibility with Terraform Stacks (#1893)
- **Custom GPT Updated** - [KH Assistant](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67df95cd1e0c8191baedfa3179061581-kh-assistant) updated with v2.19.0 features, improved knowledge base, and cost calculator
