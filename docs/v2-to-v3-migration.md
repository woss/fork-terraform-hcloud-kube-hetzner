# kube-hetzner v2 to v3 migration playbook

This playbook is the operational path for moving an existing kube-hetzner
cluster from any `v2.x` release to `v3.x`.

v3 is a major release. Treat the upgrade like an infrastructure migration, not a
routine patch bump. The goal is to make Terraform reject invalid configuration
before deployment and to keep any real infrastructure changes explicit.

## Who should use this

Use this playbook when:

- your module version is currently pinned to `2.x`;
- you want to move the same Terraform root to `3.x`;
- you need to rewrite removed or renamed inputs;
- you need to understand whether a `terraform plan` is safe.

For brand-new clusters, start from `kube.tf.example` instead.

## Golden rules

1. Do not run `terraform apply` until the v3 plan has been reviewed.
2. Back up state before changing the module version.
3. Fix input validation errors first; they are usually protecting you from a bad
   deploy.
4. Do not accept unexpected `destroy`, `replace`, or `forces replacement`
   actions.
5. If the plan wants to replace network, subnet, load balancer, control-plane,
   or NAT-router resources, stop and investigate.
6. Prefer a blue/green migration for clusters with custom network edits,
   external routes, private-only access, Robot/vSwitch coupling, or large
   multinetwork scale requirements.

## Release readiness checklist

Complete this before applying a v3 plan:

- State backup exists from `terraform state pull`.
- The module is pinned to the exact target v3 tag.
- Removed v2 inputs no longer appear in the Terraform root.
- Every inverted boolean was reviewed manually, especially public-IP,
  SELinux, kube-proxy, network-policy, placement-group, CSI, and load-balancer
  flags.
- Cilium users have reviewed the [datapath migration warning](../MIGRATION.md#cilium-datapath-migration)
  and compared effective Helm values, even if no v2-only inputs were found.
- `terraform fmt -recursive`, `terraform init -upgrade`, and
  `terraform validate` pass.
- If using OpenTofu, `tofu init -upgrade`, `tofu validate`, and `tofu plan`
  have been run in the real Terraform root.
- The saved plan has no unexpected delete/replace actions.
- Network, subnet, load balancer, NAT router, placement group, server, primary
  IP, and volume changes have a written explanation.
- Private-only, Robot/vSwitch, custom existing-network, external-overlay,
  autoscaler, Longhorn, RKE2, and multinetwork clusters have a rollback or
  blue/green path.
- The k3s upgrade policy is explicit: v2 defaulted `k3s_channel` to `v1.33`,
  while v3 defaults to `stable` and automatic Kubernetes upgrades still default
  on. Pin `k3s_version`, set `k3s_channel = "v1.33"` intentionally, or accept
  following `stable`.
- The addon version policy is explicit: unset addon version variables use
  kube-hetzner's reviewed deterministic defaults; set concrete versions to pin,
  or set `latest` only when upstream floating behavior is intentional.
- Out-of-band root SSH keys are accounted for: v3 preserves unknown
  `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` lines by default while revoking removed
  module-managed keys; set `ssh_authorized_keys_exclusive = true` only when
  strict replacement with exactly module-managed keys is intended.
- If `rancher_registration_manifest_url` was configured, rotate the Rancher
  registration token because older kustomization backup files may have written
  that credential to disk.

## Support levels

| Area | v3 support level | Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| k3s on Leap Micro | Stable default | Best path for new clusters. |
| RKE2 on Leap Micro | Supported | Heavier, stricter path; keep SELinux snapshot selection explicit when pinning snapshots. |
| MicroOS | Legacy/upgrade support | Existing nodes are supported; new nodepools default to Leap Micro unless `os = "microos"` is set. |
| Terraform | Supported | Requires Terraform `>= 1.10.1`. |
| OpenTofu | Supported | Requires OpenTofu `>= 1.10.1`; run `tofu plan` before applying with OpenTofu. |
| Flannel or Calico single-network clusters | Supported | Keep all nodes on one reachable private network. |
| Cilium IPv6/dual-stack | Plan-validated for static nodes; live E2E pending | Static control-plane and agent nodes can advertise `node-ip` families matching configured CIDRs where validation passes. Do not enable dual-stack in place on an existing IPv4-only cluster; use a new cluster or blue/green migration. `nat_router`, Robot nodes, Tailscale transport, IPv6-only standard private networking, Cilium native routing with IPv6 CIDRs, and standard-path active autoscaler pools remain rejected or deferred in this release. |
| Cilium Gateway API | Supported opt-in | Add after the base migration with `cilium_gateway_api_enabled = true`, `cni_plugin = "cilium"`, and `enable_kube_proxy = false`. |
| Embedded registry mirror | Supported opt-in | Add after the base migration for trusted clusters; review equal node trust, credential sharing, and tag-poisoning risks. |
| Tailscale node transport | Supported opt-in | Use `node_transport_mode = "tailscale"` for secure Tailnet access in single-network clusters or Flannel-first private multinetwork scale-out. |
| Cilium multinetwork public overlay | Experimental preview | Gated by `enable_experimental_cilium_public_overlay`; do not use for production upgrades yet. |
| Raw Flannel/Calico multinetwork scale | Unsupported | Separate Hetzner Networks are L3 islands; use Tailscale node transport, one private Network, or a separately managed routed/VPN fabric. |
| Cloudflare Access/Tunnel operator/app access | Documented external pattern | Manage Cloudflare resources outside kube-hetzner; do not use Cloudflare Mesh/WARP as v3 node transport. |
| User-owned Tailscale/ZeroTier/WireGuard/WARP access | Supported external pattern | Use generic hooks when the overlay is only for operator access or post-bootstrap features. |
| Robot/vSwitch | Advanced/special-case | Validate route exposure and migration plans manually. |
| Private-only clusters | Advanced/special-case | Prove SSH and join paths before applying. |
| Longhorn with attached volumes | Supported with caution | Review replacements and first-boot relabel/mount timing carefully. |

For new or redesigned clusters, use the chooser in
[`docs/v3-topology-recommendations.md`](v3-topology-recommendations.md). For
in-place upgrades, keep the first v3 apply boring: fix renamed inputs and prove
the plan first, then add Cilium Gateway API, embedded registry mirror, new
Tailscale multinetwork shards, or external Cloudflare Access/Tunnel routing in
a separate reviewed plan.

## Minimum versions

v3 requires:

- Terraform `>= 1.10.1` or OpenTofu `>= 1.10.1`
- hcloud provider `>= 1.62.0`

v3 keeps self-contained input rules in variable validation blocks, but all
cross-variable and local-dependent rules are enforced by the
`terraform_data.validation_contract` precondition surface during `terraform plan`.
The module requires a runtime compatible with Terraform/OpenTofu 1.10.1 or newer.
On Homebrew, install OpenTofu with `brew install opentofu`. OpenTofu users
should verify behavior with `tofu init -upgrade`, `tofu validate`, and
`tofu plan` before applying; full contract evaluation happens at plan time.

If you validate the module checkout itself with both Terraform and OpenTofu,
run OpenTofu in a temporary copy so its ignored lock file and provider cache do
not disturb Terraform's local state:

```bash
tmpdir="$(mktemp -d)"
rsync -a --exclude .git --exclude .terraform --exclude .terraform-tofu ./ "$tmpdir"/
(cd "$tmpdir" && tofu init -backend=false && tofu validate)
rm -rf "$tmpdir"
```

## Phase 0: capture current state

Run these commands from the Terraform root that deploys the cluster:

```bash
terraform version
terraform providers
terraform state pull > "terraform-state-before-kube-hetzner-v3-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).json"
cp kube.tf "kube.tf.before-v3.$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)" 2>/dev/null || true
```

If your configuration is split across several `.tf` files, back up those files
too.

## Phase 1: inventory v2-only inputs

Run the migration assistant from a local kube-hetzner checkout first. It is
read-only: it scans a Terraform root, reports known v2 inputs, calls out
advanced topology signals, and can also review a saved plan JSON for destructive
actions.

```bash
uv run python /path/to/kube-hetzner/scripts/v2_to_v3_migration_assistant.py --root .
```

Search for known v2 inputs:

```bash
rg -n 'kubernetes_distribution_type|k3s_token|secrets_encryption|initial_k3s_channel|install_k3s_version|initial_rke2_channel|install_rke2_version|automatically_upgrade_k3s|sys_upgrade_controller_version|additional_k3s_environment|kubeapi_port|k3s_registries|k3s_kubelet_config|k3s_audit_policy_config|k3s_audit_log_path|k3s_audit_log_maxage|k3s_audit_log_maxbackup|k3s_audit_log_maxsize|k3s_exec_server_args|k3s_exec_agent_args|k3s_global_kubelet_args|k3s_control_plane_kubelet_args|k3s_agent_kubelet_args|k3s_autoscaler_kubelet_args|subnet_amount|placement_group_disable|block_icmp_ping_in|disable_hetzner_csi|load_balancer_disable_ipv6|load_balancer_disable_public_network|use_control_plane_lb|combine_load_balancers|control_plane_lb_type|control_plane_lb_enable_public_interface|control_plane_lb_enable_public_network|lb_hostname|robot_ccm_enabled|hetzner_ccm_use_helm|enable_hetzner_ccm_helm|cilium_loadbalancer_acceleration_mode|enable_wireguard|k8s_config_updates_use_kured_sentinel|keep_disk_agents|keep_disk_cp|use_private_bastion|disable_kube_proxy|disable_network_policy|disable_selinux|k3s_prefer_bundled_bin|placement_group_compat_idx|disable_ipv4|disable_ipv6|autoscaler_disable_ipv4|autoscaler_disable_ipv6|existing_network_id|enable_x86|enable_arm|k3s_encryption_at_rest|autoscaler_labels|autoscaler_taints|extra_kustomize_' .
```

Every match should either be migrated or intentionally removed.

## Phase 2: rewrite the module contract

Use `MIGRATION.md` as the canonical v2-to-v3 variable map. The high-risk edits
are the ones that invert meaning:

```hcl
# v2
disable_hetzner_csi       = true
placement_group_disable   = true
block_icmp_ping_in        = false
disable_kube_proxy        = true
disable_network_policy    = true
disable_selinux           = false
autoscaler_disable_ipv4   = true
autoscaler_disable_ipv6   = true

# v3
enable_hetzner_csi             = false
enable_placement_groups        = false
allow_inbound_icmp             = true
enable_kube_proxy              = false
enable_network_policy          = false
enable_selinux                 = true
autoscaler_enable_public_ipv4  = false
autoscaler_enable_public_ipv6  = false
```

Nodepool public IP flags also invert:

```hcl
# v2 nodepool
disable_ipv4 = true
disable_ipv6 = false

# v3 nodepool
enable_public_ipv4 = false
enable_public_ipv6 = true
```

Primary network selection changed:

```hcl
# v2
existing_network_id = ["1234567"]

# v3
existing_network = { id = 1234567 }
```

Architecture toggles changed:

```hcl
# v2
enable_x86 = true
enable_arm = false

# v3
enabled_architectures = ["x86"]
```

Primary network assignment is now represented by omission/null. Do not set
`network_id = 0` in v3:

```hcl
agent_nodepools = [
  {
    name        = "default"
    server_type = "cx32"
    location    = "nbg1"
    labels      = []
    taints      = []
    count       = 3
    # network_id omitted/null means the primary kube-hetzner Network.
    # network_scope = "primary" when node_transport_mode = "tailscale"
  },
  {
    name        = "external-network"
    server_type = "cx32"
    location    = "nbg1"
    labels      = []
    taints      = []
    count       = 3
    network_id    = 1234567
    # network_scope = "external" when node_transport_mode = "tailscale"
  }
]
```

Control-plane nodepools no longer accept `network_id`; control planes always
stay on the primary kube-hetzner Network.

New v3 clusters default to one subnet per control-plane and agent nodepool. That
matches the released v2 subnet topology, so leave
`network_subnet_mode = "per_nodepool"` for normal in-place v2 upgrades.

`network_subnet_mode = "shared"` is an optional compact topology for new
clusters or intentional topology changes. Do not use it during an in-place v2
upgrade unless subnet replacements are expected and acceptable.

## Phase 3: migrate user kustomizations

Replace the old `extra_kustomize_*` inputs with `user_kustomizations`.

```hcl
# v2
extra_kustomize_folder              = "extra-manifests"
extra_kustomize_parameters          = { target_namespace = "argocd" }
extra_kustomize_deployment_commands = "kubectl -n argocd get pods"

# v3
user_kustomizations = {
  "1" = {
    source_folder        = "extra-manifests"
    kustomize_parameters = { target_namespace = "argocd" }
    pre_commands         = ""
    post_commands        = "kubectl -n argocd get pods"
  }
}
```

## Phase 4: handle removed inputs

Remove these inputs completely:

- `enable_iscsid`: v3 enables `iscsid` where needed.
- `k3s_encryption_at_rest`: use `enable_secrets_encryption`.
- `hetzner_ccm_use_helm` / `enable_hetzner_ccm_helm`: remove this setting.
  v3 always installs Hetzner CCM through the HelmChart manifest and migrates
  away from the old raw-manifest CCM path.
- `autoscaler_labels`: use `autoscaler_nodepools[*].labels`.
- `autoscaler_taints`: use `autoscaler_nodepools[*].taints`.

```hcl
# v2
autoscaler_labels = ["role=worker"]
autoscaler_taints = ["dedicated=gpu:NoSchedule"]

# v3
autoscaler_nodepools = [
  {
    name        = "workers"
    server_type = "cx32"
    location    = "fsn1"
    min_nodes   = 1
    max_nodes   = 3
    labels      = { role = "worker" }
    taints = [
      {
        key    = "dedicated"
        value  = "gpu"
        effect = "NoSchedule"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Phase 5: update the version and initialize

Pin the module to the target v3 tag:

```hcl
module "kube-hetzner" {
  source  = "kube-hetzner/kube-hetzner/hcloud"
  version = "3.2.1"
}
```

Then run:

```bash
terraform fmt -recursive
terraform init -upgrade
terraform validate
```

Fix `terraform validate` failures before planning, but do not treat `validate`
as the full v3 contract. v3 intentionally keeps self-contained rules in variable
validation and enforces every cross-variable rule through
`terraform_data.validation_contract` preconditions during `terraform plan`.

The first v3 apply is not purely local Terraform bookkeeping. It SSHes to
existing control-plane and agent nodes for `terraform_data.initial_readiness`,
reconciles `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`, may create validation-only
`terraform_data` state, and may rerun the k3s/RKE2 kustomization once as trigger
state and rendered addon payloads migrate.

## Phase 6: create and inspect a plan

```bash
terraform plan -out=v3-upgrade.tfplan
terraform show v3-upgrade.tfplan
```

For machine-readable review:

```bash
terraform show -json v3-upgrade.tfplan > v3-upgrade-plan.json
uv run python /path/to/kube-hetzner/scripts/v2_to_v3_migration_assistant.py --root . --plan-json v3-upgrade-plan.json --strict
```

Run the protected-infrastructure gate:

```bash
terraform show -json v3-upgrade.tfplan \
  | jq -r '
      .resource_changes[]?
      | select(.type as $type | [
          "hcloud_server",
          "hcloud_network",
          "hcloud_network_subnet",
          "hcloud_load_balancer",
          "hcloud_volume",
          "hcloud_primary_ip",
          "hcloud_placement_group",
          "hcloud_firewall"
        ] | index($type))
      | select(.change.actions | index("delete"))
      | "\(.address): \(.type) \(.change.actions | join(","))"
    '
```

Contract: no output means the protected-infrastructure gate passed. ANY output
is a stop condition: do not apply, and investigate the proposed destroy/replace
first. This gate is the hard no-destroy floor; still review every
non-protected resource action in the full plan. Do not approve a plan because it
is "probably fine." Make every replacement intentional.

### Network and SSH transition warnings

No server replacements does **not** mean a network transition is safe. Stop
on standalone `hcloud_server_network` attachment deletion or changed/unknown
server `network` or `public_net` values. Preserving the old private IP alone
does not eliminate the attachment deletion. Private IP/MAC changes can disrupt
node identity and interface naming, and public-network updates can power-cycle
nodes without replacing the server resource.

Use the strict auditor above in addition to manual inspection of the saved
plan. A passing report does not certify guest routing or readiness between
node changes. Neither targeted applies nor `-parallelism=1` establish a safe
rolling migration. Existing guests do not automatically receive updated
cloud-init repairs. Before enabling NAT on existing nodes, verify persistent
guest routes, egress, management access, and rollback; a previously installed
fallback route may preserve egress but must not be assumed. Check existing
autoscaled nodes separately from Terraform-managed servers.

Keep SSH-port and network-topology changes separate from the module upgrade.
Changing `ssh_port` alone does not migrate existing listeners. For an accidental
change, restore the original configured port and review a fresh plan, then
verify each node rather than assuming all nodes recover. See
[SSH port lifecycle and recovery](ssh.md#ssh-port-lifecycle) and the
[network transition safety limits](../MIGRATION.md#network-and-ssh-transition-limits).

### Quick diagnostics for failed plans

When `terraform validate` or `terraform plan` fails, do not work around the
validation first. Read the error message and inspect the relevant inputs:

```bash
terraform validate
terraform plan -out=v3-upgrade.tfplan
rg -n 'network_id|existing_network|multinetwork_mode|control_plane_endpoint|nat_router|use_private_nat_router_bastion|enable_public_ipv4|enable_public_ipv6|autoscaler|placement_group|attached_volumes|user_kustomizations' .
```

If a plan was created, rerun the protected-infrastructure gate from Phase 6 and
inspect `terraform show v3-upgrade.tfplan`; keep that gate as the canonical
machine-readable stop check.

For join or reachability failures after a partial apply, check the planned
endpoint and the node connection path first:

```bash
terraform output
rg -n 'control_plane_endpoint|node_connection_overrides|firewall_ssh_source|firewall_kube_api_source|optional_bastion_host|nat_router' .
```

For Cilium multinetwork issues, verify the declared topology before debugging
Kubernetes:

```bash
rg -n 'cni_plugin|multinetwork_mode|multinetwork_transport_ip_family|network_id|enable_public_ipv4|enable_public_ipv6|control_plane_endpoint' .
```

## Phase 7: special cases

### High-risk topology scan

| Topology | Why it is risky | v3 recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Private-only nodes | SSH and Kubernetes join paths can be stranded if bastion, NAT, firewall, or endpoint settings disagree. | Prove access before applying; prefer blue/green if unsure. |
| Existing Hetzner Networks | Out-of-band routes/subnets can conflict with v3 validation and attachment accounting. | Use `existing_network = { id = ... }`; review subnets and route exposure. |
| Multiple Hetzner Networks | Networks are separate L3 islands and servers can attach to at most three Networks. | Use `node_transport_mode = "tailscale"` for the supported private path, or treat `multinetwork_mode = "cilium_public_overlay"` as a lab-only preview. |
| Robot/vSwitch | Route exposure can be provider-managed or manually managed depending on ownership. | Validate `expose_routes_to_vswitch` and existing Network ownership. |
| NAT router from old v2 clusters | Pre-v2.19 primary IP state can show replacement. | Import existing primary IPs if they must be preserved. |
| Autoscaler with external networks | Cluster Autoscaler needs per-network `HCLOUD_NETWORK` behavior and a cross-network join path. | Use external autoscaler `network_id` with Tailscale node transport or the experimental Cilium public-overlay preview. |
| Longhorn or attached volumes | Replacements or mount changes can affect stateful workloads. | Back up data and review every volume action. |
| External overlays such as Tailscale | Auth keys, ACLs, route approvals, DNS, and operator lifecycle live outside kube-hetzner unless using the narrow Tailscale node-transport contract. | Use `node_transport_mode = "tailscale"` for cluster transport; use generic hooks for operator access only. |

### NAT router primary IPs from old v2 clusters

Clusters created before v2.19.0 may show NAT router primary IP replacement. If
you need to preserve those IPs, migrate state as described in `MIGRATION.md`
before applying v3.

### Private-only clusters

Private-only nodes must have a working SSH and Kubernetes join path before
upgrade. Validate NAT router, bastion, `control_plane_endpoint`, and
control-plane load balancer settings together. v3 will reject many stranded
private-only combinations during plan.

### Robot/vSwitch clusters

If using `existing_network` with `vswitch_id`, v3 cannot manage
`expose_routes_to_vswitch` on that existing Network. Enable route exposure on the
existing Network manually or set:

```hcl
expose_routes_to_vswitch = false
```

### Tailscale access and multinetwork scale

v3 includes a supported Tailscale node-transport path:

```hcl
node_transport_mode = "tailscale"
```

For single-network clusters, this gives Terraform, kubeconfig, and operator SSH
a private Tailnet path while public Kubernetes API/SSH firewall rules can stay
closed. Set `tailscale_node_transport.routing.advertise_node_private_routes =
false` when every node remains on the primary Hetzner Network.

For multinetwork scale-out, keep
`tailscale_node_transport.routing.advertise_node_private_routes = true`. This
keeps Kubernetes node IPs on Hetzner private addresses, advertises each node's
Hetzner private `/32` route through Tailscale with subnet-route SNAT disabled,
and requires Tailnet ACL route auto-approval for the configured node tags.
Every active Tailscale agent/autoscaler nodepool must set
`network_scope = "primary"` or `network_scope = "external"` so same-root
external Network IDs still fail invalid configurations during `terraform plan`.
Introduce multinetwork scale in a separate audited plan after the base v2-to-v3
upgrade unless you are intentionally doing blue/green.

v3 also includes a lab-only Cilium public-overlay preview through:

```hcl
enable_experimental_cilium_public_overlay = true
multinetwork_mode = "cilium_public_overlay"
cni_plugin        = "cilium"
```

This mode uses public node addresses plus Cilium WireGuard/tunnel overlay. It is
not a Flannel or Calico private-network feature, and it must not be used for
production upgrades until the live Cilium datapath test passes. External Network
IDs may be set on agent nodepools; autoscaler nodepools may also set external
Network IDs with Tailscale node transport or the Cilium public-overlay preview,
where kube-hetzner renders one autoscaler Deployment per effective Network.
Primary Network nodepools omit `network_id`.

### Placement groups

Hetzner spread Placement Groups are capped at 10 servers. v3 auto-shards
implicit count-based placement groups every 10 servers. Explicit named placement
groups still fail validation above 10; split them manually.

## Phase 8: apply

Apply only after all of these are true:

- `terraform validate` passes.
- The v3 plan has no unexpected replacements or destroys.
- Any NAT-router primary IP, network, subnet, or load-balancer changes are
  understood.
- You have a state backup.
- You have followed [Rollback and abort paths](#rollback-and-abort-paths) and
  know whether you will retry v3, restore state/re-pin v2, or switch to
  blue/green.

Then:

```bash
terraform apply v3-upgrade.tfplan
```

After apply, verify:

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl -n kube-system get pods
kubectl get storageclass
```

For Cilium clusters:

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l k8s-app=cilium
cilium status
```

## Rollback and abort paths

Before `terraform apply`, aborting is just a version rollback: re-pin the module
to the previous `v2.x` tag, run `terraform init -upgrade`, then re-plan. The
plan should return to the previous no-op or known baseline; the state backup
from Phase 1 is the safety net if local state is damaged.

After a failed or partial apply, prefer convergence first. Fix the reported
error, run a fresh `terraform plan -out=v3-upgrade.tfplan`, rerun the
protected-infrastructure gate from Phase 6, and apply only the newly reviewed
plan. If the gate passed before the failed apply, the expected v3 changes are
node-local and Terraform-state changes such as authorized-key reconciliation,
rendered kustomization/addon payloads, validation `terraform_data`, and possible
k3s/RKE2 config service restarts.

The escape hatch is restoring the pre-upgrade state backup and re-pinning the
module to the previous v2 tag, then re-running `terraform init -upgrade` and
`terraform plan`. That does not automatically revert node-local v3 changes. Use
the actual backup filename from Phase 1:

```bash
terraform state push terraform-state-before-kube-hetzner-v3-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.json
terraform init -upgrade
terraform plan
```

Then check `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`, k3s/RKE2 config files under
`/etc/rancher`, `/var/post_install` rendered addon/kustomization payloads,
service status, node readiness, system pods, and critical workloads.

For high-risk topologies or any plan that is hard to explain, use blue/green:
build a separate v3 cluster, migrate workloads and traffic, and keep the v2
cluster intact until the v3 path is proven. See
[`MIGRATION.md#production-in-place-upgrades-safety-model`](../MIGRATION.md#production-in-place-upgrades-safety-model)
for the summary safety model.
